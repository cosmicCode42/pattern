// A simple pattern game. Currently planning 4 buttons pressed in order on the screen.
// Idea: make patterns flash increasingly more quickly as time goes on [to a maximum speed].
// Idea: increase pattern length as time goes on. Start at 3; end at 8?
// Idea: reset pattern length with each increase in speed.

const gameStuff = {
    //Need to store the buttons, a turn counter, a pattern counter
    buttons: ['button1', 'button2', 'button3', 'button4'],
};
